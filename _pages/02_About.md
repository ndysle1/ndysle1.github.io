<h4>
My name is Nicholas Dysle and I am a data analyst that is currently working for an analytics company based in Washington, D.C. While the majority of my coding experience is in R and PostgreSQL, I also have some familiarity with Python. In terms of data visualization, I enjoy using R packages (e.g., ggplot & plotly) and Tableau. If you'd like to see some of the visualizations I have made or the code I have written, feel free to visit my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/nicholas.dysle#!/" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ndysle1" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository. <br>
<br>
In terms of education, I have a Master of Applied Economics and a Master of Public Administration from The Ohio State University. These degrees opened my eyes to the world of data and set me on my current career trajectory. <br> 
<br>
Prior to returning to graduate school, I held a variety of positions from Peace Corps Volunteer to dairy farmer and gained many skills from each of my experiences. Feel free to head over to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasdysle/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> if you'd like to learn more about my past positions. <br> 
<br>
I hope you find the site easy to use. If you have any questions or would like to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:nicholasdysle@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>! <br>

Thanks for visiting my data analytics portfolio! </h4>
