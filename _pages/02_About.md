<h4>
My name is Nicholas Dysle and I am a data analyst that is currently working for a small company in Washington, D.C. While the majority of my coding experience is in R and PostgreSQL, I have also been able to build foundational Python skills at work and in my free time. In terms of data visualization, I enjoy using R packages (e.g., ggplot & plotly) and Tableau. If you'd like to see some of the visualizations I have made or the code I have written, feel free to navigate my Tableau Public or GitHub repository. <br>
<br>
In terms of education, I have a Master of Applied Economics and a Master of Public Administration from The Ohio State University. These degrees opened my eyes to the world of data analysis and set me on my current career trajectory. <br> 
<br>
Prior to returning to graduate school, I held a variety of positions from United States Peace Corps Volunteer to dairy farmer and gained many skills from each of my experiences. Feel free to head over to my LinkedIn if you are interested in my past positions. <br> 
<br>
I hope you find the site easy to use. If you have any questions or would like to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an email! <br>

Thanks for visiting my data analytics portfolio! </h4>
